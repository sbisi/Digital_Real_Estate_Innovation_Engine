# Prototype Summary for Digital Real Estate Innovation Engine

Based on the provided PDF document, 'Digital Real Estate Leadership durch Competitive Intelligence und digitales crowdbasiertes Trend- und Technologiemanagement', the core concept revolves around a digital platform to support strategy and innovation processes within the real estate industry. The prototype aims to address the need for effective trend and technology management, competitive intelligence, and collaborative idea generation.

## Key Functional Groups:

The document outlines four main functional groups:

1.  **Add & Connect:** This module allows users to add new content (trends, technologies, inspirations) to the system. It supports various input methods, including URL insertion, browser extensions, and manual entry. Users can also connect new content with existing information.

2.  **Explore & Select:** This module enables users to browse and discover content within the platform. It features a 

Hot or Not" selection mechanism for new content, an overview display, and various filtering and search options (text search, advanced filters, smart playlists).

3.  **Rate & Create:** In this module, users can review and rate pre-selected content. Based on these evaluations, they can create "Opportunity Spaces" â€“ strategic fields of action. This involves detailed views of content, options to add to favorites or playlists, and the ability to assess opportunities based on defined criteria.

4.  **Ideate & Realize:** While less detailed in the provided sections, this module is implied to support the generation of ideas and the realization of innovation projects based on the identified opportunity spaces. It likely involves idea management, project tracking, and roadmap creation.

## Key Features and Requirements:

Based on the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the document, the prototype should include:

*   **User Management:** Role-specific logins (User, Poweruser, Content Supplier, Expert, Sales), profile management, and permission concepts.
*   **Content Management:**
    *   **Import:** Standardized import of trends, technologies, and inspirations, including bulk import via Excel templates. Drag & Drop functionality for content capture.
    *   **Classification:** Ability to classify content by predefined categories (trends, technologies, applications, companies) and assign metadata (title, image, description, PESTEL classification, industry, relevance for roles, ratings).
    *   **Quality Assurance:** Plausibility checks for duplicate content, and a workflow for experts to review and approve new content.
    *   **Search & Filter:** Fast full-text search with autocomplete, advanced filtering based on various criteria (roles, processes, tags, status, ratings), and the ability to save search profiles as 


smart playlists.
    *   **Rating & Commenting:** Functionality to rate and comment on individual content elements, with role-specific views of ratings (internal, external, expert, average).
    *   **Reporting & Export:** Generation of clear and simple reports, role-specific reports (e.g., Top 10 trends), automatic push notifications for new content, and export functions to Excel and PowerPoint.
*   **User Interface (UX):** Intuitive and easy navigation, wireframes and storyboards for key use cases (e.g., trend pre-selection, technology selection, opportunity space creation), and a focus on visual design.
*   **Technical Requirements:**
    *   Web-based application, compatible with conventional operating systems and browsers.
    *   Multi-user capability within a customer, with the ability to create multiple users per customer.
    *   Good performance.
    *   Centralized role and authorization concept.
    *   Database-driven with automatic data backup/regular backups.
    *   Fast technical support.
    *   Multi-language support (German, English, optional French).
    *   Secure data sets and user information.
    *   Integration with external websites.

## Proposed Technical Architecture:

Given the requirements, a modern web application architecture would be suitable. This would likely involve:

*   **Frontend:** A responsive web interface built with a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) to provide the rich interactive experience described in the UX sections (drag & drop, real-time search, dynamic filtering).
*   **Backend:** A robust backend framework (e.g., Python with Flask/Django, Node.js with Express) to handle user authentication, data management, business logic, and API endpoints for the frontend. This would also manage content import, classification, and reporting.
*   **Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) to store content metadata, user information, ratings, comments, and other structured data. The choice would depend on the specific data model and scalability needs.
*   **Search Engine:** For efficient full-text search and advanced filtering, a dedicated search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr) would be beneficial, integrated with the backend.
*   **File Storage:** A scalable solution for storing images and potentially other attachments (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, or a local file system for simpler deployments).
*   **Push Notifications:** A mechanism for sending push notifications (e.g., web push APIs, dedicated notification services) for new content alerts.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Standardized authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) and a robust authorization system to enforce role-based access control.

## Prototype Scope:

For a prototype, we can focus on implementing the core functionalities of the 'Add & Connect' and 'Explore & Select' modules, along with basic user management and content display. This would demonstrate the key value proposition of the innovation engine. The 'Rate & Create' and 'Ideate & Realize' modules could be simplified or partially implemented for the prototype phase, with a clear roadmap for future development.
